Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
Our Pledge
In the interest of maintaining a typical, real-world environment, we as contributors pledge to making participation in our project the same as any commonsense person would expect in any other similar environment, and do not feel the need to explain this in detail as if you are a child. 

Our Standards
Don't be an idiot. There is no specific list, rule, or enumerated guidelines on what that all entails in its definition, we all know it when we see it.
You may use whatever language you like, as long as it abides by U.S. law. This is a GitHub project, and has absolutluty zero authority or right to try and dictate how you speak. The fact that the default "Code of Conduct" even mentions this subject should be offensive to any adult. That said, try and treat people with the same respect that you would any other person in daily life. If you are too abrasive and have little to contribute, you will likely just be barred from the project and forgotton about.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate.

Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at efreed09@gmail.com, where they will in all liklihood be utterly ignored unless they violate U.S. law.

Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4 
That garbage was promptly deleted and all but the format was retained.
